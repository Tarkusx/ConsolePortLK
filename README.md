# ConsolePortLK

## This is not a Wrath of the Lich King Classic AddOn.
This AddOn represents an learning experiment, it is the backported version of ConsolePort 1.9.17 for World of Warcraft - Wrath of the Lich King legacy client (3.3.5a).

<br />

<h2>What is ConsolePort?</h2>
ConsolePort is an interface add-on for World of Warcraft that will give you a handful of nifty features
in order to let you play the game on a controller - without inconvenience.
<br/><br/>
Consisting of several modules, ConsolePort is a fully-fledged solution to handling all the quirks in a game where gamepad support was not intended,
including interface navigation, custom-tailored UI elements to assist in gameplay, and easy-to-use targeting systems
for end-game content. As of Shadowlands, No external software is required. However for this backported version a custom
WoWmapper version was developed to have a better integration with the Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a) client using it's older memory reading functions.
